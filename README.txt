To be able to run the training notebook:
- You need to install the conda environment in environment.yml, and run the training notebook on that.
- You also have to download (Preferably to your drive) the competitions dataset, or change the loading function in the ChunksDataset class.
- Finally, if you wish to have access to the trained models, you need to navigate to my public vc-id models: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/romgat/vc-id-models-rg

The inference notebook is almost identical to the original.
