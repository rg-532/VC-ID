To be able to run the training notebook:
- You need to install the conda environment in environment.yml, and run the training notebook on that.
- You also have to download (Preferably to your drive) the competitions dataset, or change the loading function in the ChunksDataset class.
- Finally, if you wish to have access to the trained models, you need to navigate to my public vc-id models: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/romgat/vc-id-models-rg

The inference notebook is almost identical to the original, due to having my own written notebook fail for some unknown reason. It does include what is necessary to make my submissions, as long as you have access to the models.
